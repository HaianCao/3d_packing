/**
 * REFACTORING SUMMARY
 * 
 * âœ… COMPLETED REFACTORING:
 * 
 * 1. BROKEN DOWN main.js (2697 lines) INTO 9 FOCUSED MODULES:
 *    - ItemManager.js: Item operations (add, remove, validate, JSON loading)
 *    - WeightManager.js: Algorithm weights management
 *    - CameraManager.js: 3D camera state preservation
 *    - VisualizationEngine.js: 3D plotting with Plotly
 *    - TrainingManager.js: Training data and configuration
 *    - APIService.js: API communication (pack, training, fake_data)
 *    - DataExporter.js: Data export operations (JSON, CSV)
 *    - UIManager.js: UI interactions and event handling
 *    - StepManager.js: Step-by-step visualization controls
 * 
 * 2. MAIN COORDINATOR:
 *    - BinPackingVisualizer.js: Composes all managers, handles coordination
 * 
 * 3. SOLID PRINCIPLES APPLIED:
 *    - Single Responsibility: Each class has one clear purpose
 *    - Open/Closed: Easy to extend without modifying existing code
 *    - Liskov Substitution: Managers can be easily replaced
 *    - Interface Segregation: Clean, focused interfaces
 *    - Dependency Inversion: Main class depends on abstractions
 * 
 * 4. IMPROVED COMPATIBILITY:
 *    - Added support for old JSON format (L, W, H instead of length, width, height)
 *    - Added support for num_axis instead of number_axis
 *    - Added support for weights in parameters.weights location
 *    - Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
 * 
 * 5. FILES UPDATED:
 *    - templates/index.html: Updated script includes for modular loading
 *    - All 9 core modules created in static/js/core/
 *    - BinPackingVisualizer.js: New main coordinator
 *    - main.js: Converted to compatibility info file
 * 
 * ðŸŽ¯ BENEFITS:
 * - Much easier to maintain and debug
 * - Better testability (each module can be unit tested)
 * - Clearer code organization
 * - Easier to add new features
 * - Better error isolation
 * - Improved code reusability
 * 
 * ðŸ“‹ ALL ORIGINAL FUNCTIONALITY PRESERVED:
 * - Item management (add, remove, clear)
 * - JSON file loading (with improved format support)
 * - 3D visualization and camera controls
 * - Algorithm weights configuration  
 * - Training data management
 * - Fake data generation
 * - Data export operations
 * - Step-by-step visualization
 * - API communication
 * - UI interactions and feedback
